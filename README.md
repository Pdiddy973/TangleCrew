## Commands

### 🎡 `/spinwheel` — Prize Wheel

Spins an animated prize wheel and picks one or more random winners from a list of entries.

**When to use it:**
- Giveaways (pick a winner from everyone who entered)
- Loot splits (randomly assign a drop from a boss trip)
- Event prizes (randomly select who gets first pick of a reward)
- Deciding activities (spin between bossing locations, minigames, or skilling tasks)
- Any situation where you want a fair, visible, and fun random pick

**Options:**

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `entries` | Yes | Comma-separated list of names or numeric ranges, e.g. `Alice,Bob,Carol` or `1-10` or `Alice,1-5,Bob` |
| `title` | No | Label shown on the wheel (default: `Wheel Spin`) |
| `winners` | No | How many winners to pick (1–10, default: 1) |
| `message` | No | Custom win message — use `{winner}` as a placeholder (default: `Winner is {winner}`) |
| `shuffle` | No | Shuffle the entry order before spinning (default: false) |
| `ping` | No | Send an `@here` or `@everyone` notification when the winner is announced |

**Range auto-fill:** Entries like `1-10` automatically expand to `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10`. Works with any range in either direction (e.g. `5-1` counts down).

**How it works:**
1. The bot renders and sends an animated GIF of the wheel spinning, easing to a stop on the winner's slice.
2. Once the GIF finishes playing, the bot edits the same message to reveal the winner alongside the full entry list.
3. If a ping option was selected, a short follow-up is sent so Discord fires the notification.
